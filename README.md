## python and sql project

### pro1: Inter galactic travel
This project contain over 500,000 data set in which i carefully cleaned and analyze in python and other platform like gretl and evanmiller this data set which is large proves that the use of iteration to move data to my sql can only be done using small data
visit my project  repository for more details 

### pro2 : absenteeism
This project contains only 700 data set which was cearfully clean and analyze in python and other platform such as gretl and evanmiller site. This data iteration  was successful in these data you get to view model from python and gretl and also use CAP excel templates to test the model.
